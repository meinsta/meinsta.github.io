<p>A piece recently arrived shipped in a cryogenic shipping container that was originally excavated from a dig site in what was formerly the West Village. At this point, it’s very hard to discern what the entire intent of this piece was since it arrived fairly damaged; it is my responsibility to research the artist’s contemporaries to see if I can find similar handiwork amongst them, and also pull up the archives in hopes that the piece was featured in a publication of the time. I will also be in contact with the curator on-site. The piece is fragmented into several pieces because much of the soldering available at the time is now brittle and chipping off. It is my responsibility to either find the closest equivalent or perhaps create it from synthetic analogs. Many of the raw materials, including the quartz crystal that once kept time within the backbone of the piece, have been unattainable since our natural resources were exhausted a decade ago.</p>

<p>I don’t want to lose the outsider approach that is reflected in this piece. For example, none of the wires are cut consistent and the stripped ends are uneven. Much of the soldering was clearly inexpertly applied. This makeshift quality speaks to the cultural milieu of the creative tech scene in the early aughts. I want to convey to the public that this work is a hallmark of the art/tech renaissance in the US. Society is so immersed in technology and industrial simulacrum that these handmade objects, in contrast, reveal a visceral creation process. The human tactile imprints on the work are so foreign to these times, when most everything is generated by AI. It’s my responsibility, as custodian of this work, to repair the work to the best of my ability without disrupting these essential qualities of the work.</p>

<p>There were many competing bidders over the West Village finds on our virtual archeological auction app. At the moment, it’s a trend amongst the elite to display retro outsider work in their luxury tenements. At this rate, few people get to actually experience and connect with the work of this time period. The chat waiting room was filled with art gallery arbiters who would most likely not know how to properly restore such delicate pieces. I shudder to think about how much of our cultural heritage has been mishandled in order to make a quick buck in the name of what is fashionable at the moment. In my opinion, it is disrespectful to the art and the artist to treat their work as commodity. The museum serves as a stronghold for preservationist thinking as opposed to financial gain.</p>

<p>As I did this assignment, I was surprised at the number of encounters documented for Turing and Shannon, with seemingly no primary source
  to back up any of the conversations cited between the two. Even quotes databases returned Turing's time at Bell Labs:
  <blockquote>Bell Labs Cafeteria, New York, 1943: His high pitched voice already stood out above the general murmur of well-behaved junior executives grooming themselves for promotion within the Bell corporation. Then he was suddenly heard to say: "No, I'm not interested in developing a powerful brain. All I'm after is just a mediocre brain, something like the President of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company." (<a href="http://www.azquotes.com/quote/893082" target=_blank>source</a>)
  </blockquote>
  I still have <strong>no</strong> clue the source of this anecdote, but okay. Maybe it's a line from the embellished Broadway performance about his life.
</p>
<p>However, here's what I <strong>did</strong> uncover.</p>

<p>Some design agency (<a href="http://docubyte.co.uk/projects/guide-to-computing/#.V2AOl5MrLBI" target=_blank>docubyte</a>) documented an array of historic computers that weren't previously captured via contemporary photography and retouching methods. There's a great shot of Turing's Pilot ACE that isn't a primary document per se, nor does it have much to do with the Bell Labs (although this was conceived in the early 50s shortly after his time here in NYC), but I thought the article and this photo were really beautiful, and captured some of the spirit of Turing's creation that I feel are actually lost in older documentation:</p>

<p>You may be wondering. Meina, did you end up completing your homework assignment, or did you just dick around on the internet looking at design blogs that worship computer Gods of yore? Welp, along the rabbit hole I came across two articles that brought some clarity to the Turing-Shannon relationship.</p>

<p>The first article, published in March 1950 in <i>Philosophical Magazine</i> by Claude Shannon entitled <u>Programming a Computer for Playing Chess </u> (<a href="http://archive.computerhistory.org/projects/chess/related_materials/text/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon.062303002.pdf" target=_blank>source</a>) was the first article about computer chess. Sound familiar?<p>

<p>The second paper is from Alan Turing, <u>Chess</u>, published in <i>Faster Than Thought</i> just three years later in 1953, and is a hallmark in digital computing writing and discourse. Here is <i>Faster Than Thought</i> for sale on a publishing site for around 389 USD (<a href="https://alembicrarebooks.com/products/turing-alan-bowden-b-v-faster-than-thought" target="_blank">source</a>):</p>

<p>It took a bit of digging to find some concrete connections between these contemporaries. It's still hard to say if these programming theses were conceived precisely in the Bell Labs, but we can say for certain that Shannon and Turing must have at least had correspondences. How else can we explain Turing and Shannon's obsession with chess as a template for computing within the very decade that they both worked at the same facility?</p>
