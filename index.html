<p>As I did this assignment, I was surprised at the number of encounters documented for Turing and Shannon, with seemingly no primary source
  to back up any of the conversations cited between the two. Even quotes databases returned Turing's time at Bell Labs:
  <blockquote>Bell Labs Cafeteria, New York, 1943: His high pitched voice already stood out above the general murmur of well-behaved junior executives grooming themselves for promotion within the Bell corporation. Then he was suddenly heard to say: "No, I'm not interested in developing a powerful brain. All I'm after is just a mediocre brain, something like the President of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company." (<a href="http://www.azquotes.com/quote/893082" target=_blank>source</a>)
  </blockquote>
  I still have <strong>no</strong> clue the source of this anecdote, but okay. Maybe it's a line from the embellished Broadway performance about his life.
</p>
<p>However, here's what I <strong>did</strong> uncover.</p>

<p>Some design agency (<a href="http://docubyte.co.uk/projects/guide-to-computing/#.V2AOl5MrLBI" target=_blank>docubyte</a>) documented an array of historic computers that weren't previously captured via contemporary photography and retouching methods. There's a great shot of Turing's Pilot ACE that isn't a primary document per se, nor does it have much to do with the Bell Labs (although this was conceived in the early 50s shortly after his time here in NYC), but I thought the article and this photo were really beautiful, and captured some of the spirit of Turing's creation that I feel are actually lost in older documentation:</p>

<p>You may be wondering. Meina, did you end up completing your homework assignment, or did you just dick around on the internet looking at design blogs that worship computer Gods of yore? Welp, along the rabbit hole I came across two articles that brought some clarity to the Turing-Shannon relationship.</p>

<p>The first article, published in March 1950 in <i>Philosophical Magazine</i> by Claude Shannon entitled <u>Programming a Computer for Playing Chess </u> (<a href="http://archive.computerhistory.org/projects/chess/related_materials/text/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon.062303002.pdf" target=_blank>source</a>) was the first article about computer chess. Sound familiar?<p>

<p>The second paper is from Alan Turing, <u>Chess</u>, published in <i>Faster Than Thought</i> just three years later in 1953, and is a hallmark in digital computing writing and discourse. Here is <i>Faster Than Thought</i> for sale on a publishing site for around 389 USD (<a href="https://alembicrarebooks.com/products/turing-alan-bowden-b-v-faster-than-thought" target="_blank">source</a>):</p>

<p>It took a bit of digging to find some concrete connections between these contemporaries. It's still hard to say if these programming theses were conceived precisely in the Bell Labs, but we can say for certain that Shannon and Turing must have at least had correspondences. How else can we explain Turing and Shannon's obsession with chess as a template for computing within the same decade that they both worked at the same facilities?</p>
